This paper proposes a Traditional Chinese Painting (TCP) generation system, InkSpirit. The key idea is to employ an expert knowledge-driven strategy to address the TCP problem. Specifically, a TCP dataset, an artistic conception-inscription corpus, and a generation framework based on ComfyUI workflow for precise element control have been developed. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.
